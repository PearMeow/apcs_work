Activity 1
1. a. sentimentVal
   b. Yes, a string. It returns an incompatible type error when compiling if an integer is used.
   c. It returns a float value.

2. aaron       -  -0.32
   abandoned   -  -0.09
   happy       -  0.64

3. a. It would compile because the number can be a float and even if the word wasn't there it would be 0.
   b. It wouldn't compile because there would be an incompatible type error.
   c. It would return 0 because there is more than 1 word in the string.

Activity 2
1. unsure why not working and spent too much time
