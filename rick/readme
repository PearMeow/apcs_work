WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS:
* It shows a way to process a gif by frame and also includes music.
* This gif/animation is 10 frames per second, but you may change the FPS to
  create a faster or slower animation.

WHY YOU CARE:
* This should be particularly helpful if you are trying to make a game with
  background music or need an animation for an avatar's walk.
* This can also be a model for uploading images, either for backgrounds
  or for characters or objects in the foreground.
