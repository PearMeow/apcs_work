HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle/A new way of sorting/Sorting by making other people do work/

time spent: 0 hrs

DISCO
Observables:
* Deck of cards
* Starts off with 1 person with all the cards
* Split deck in half, give each half to other people
* Other people repeat same process
* When people have only 1 card, they give it back to the person they got it from
* That person sorts the cards, and then gives it back to the person they got it from
* Repeat until deck is sorted, or at least we tried to do that in class
Cleanup:
* There's no need to wait until 1 card: when a person has one card they just give it back
which seems like a waste of a step
* The splitting of cards should be in sync: if the deck is split into 2 hands of 26, then those should
be split at the same time so there are 4 hands of 13, so everything is in sync and nobody has a hand 
of 6 while someone else has a hand of 26

QCC
* Are there more ways to clean up this process, or even an entirely new algorithm that is better?
* What happens if a person has an odd number of cards?

THINKER FIRMWARE
when thinker recieves card(s)
if thinker recieves one card
    give card back to giver
else if first time recieving cards
    split cards in half, give each half to a thinker with no cards
else 
    order cards and give back to first giver
