Compile time errors - syntax errors
Run-time errors - something goes wrong while running (eg StackOverflowError)
Logic errors - wrong thing done but right code
Bisection debugging - delete code and run, make backup before
Sometimes compiler is wrong
Print statements can help with debugging
Write readable expressions
Use temp variables that you can display before return
println is immediate, print sometimes isn't
Sometimes you need other people to look at your code
