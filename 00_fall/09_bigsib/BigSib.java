HW<09> -- <What Are BigSibs Good For?/Greeting People/Using another file's methods to greet people in a file>
<2021>-<10>-<01>

DISCOVERIES:
<git add doesn't create a file, it adds the file to github for viewing.
You can make a file without a main method and you can use the contents of that file in other files.>

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS:
<Why do you need public in front of the class and the main method?
Are main methods actually called methods or are they called functions?
What does static do?
What is good style in java coding?>
*/

public class BigSib{

    public static void greet(String str) {
        System.out.print("What's up ");
        System.out.print(str);
	System.out.println("?");
  }
